Repository for the novel code used in the publication entitled Multi-scale Molecular Imaging of Human Cells reveals COPI and COPII Vesicles at ER Exit Sites.

The morphology analysis was adapted from Bieber, A. et al. In situ structural analysis reveals membrane shape transitions during autophagosome formation. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 119, e2209823119 (2022).

Morphology_analysis processes segmented membranes saved as .mrc files. The input membranes follow the naming convention "XYZ-COP1.mrc" or "XYZ-COP2.mrc". The Plots_git, CircularityPlots_git and Fluorescence_Cluster_Distance_Anaslysis_git files take the .npy output of Morphology_analysis and create the graphs depicted in the paper.
